# Stark Rocket Airdrop Contract

Welcome to the official repository of Stark Rocket, an innovative Airdrop contract implemented in Cairo for the StarkNet ecosystem. Stark Rocket is designed to revolutionize the way airdrops are distributed in the blockchain space, ensuring a fair and decentralized approach to token allocation.


## Features

- **Airdrop Mechanism**: Stark Rocket introduces a unique airdrop system, allowing for equitable and wide distribution of tokens.
- **Wallet Balance Limit**: To promote fairness and decentralization, the contract ensures that no wallet can receive more than a specified percentage of the total airdrop supply.
- **StarkNet Security**: Built on the StarkNet blockchain, Stark Rocket benefits from its decentralized, secure, and scalable infrastructure.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: While primarily an airdrop contract, Stark Rocket is compatible with the ERC20 interface, ensuring seamless integration with existing wallets and platforms.
